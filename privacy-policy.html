                        (g) upload, post, email, transmit or otherwise make available any material that contains software viruses or any other computer code, files or programs designed to interrupt, destroy or limit the functionality of any computer software or hardware or telecommunications equipment;

                        have provided is accurate; and a statement, made under penalty of perjury, that you are the copyright owner or are authorized to act on behalf of the copyright owner.

                    <h4>APPLICABLE LAWS</h4>
                    <p>
                        This Site and App is controlled by Go Climb from its offices within the United Kingdom.
                        Go Climb makes no representation that the Content in the Site and App or the Site and App are appropriate or available for use in other locations,
                        and access to them from territories where their content or use is illegal is prohibited.
                        Those who choose to access this Site and App from locations outside of the United Kingdom do so on their own initiative and are responsible for compliance with applicable local laws.
                        You may not use or export the Content in violation of U.K export laws and regulations.
                        Any action related to the Site and App, the Content or the Terms shall be governed by UK law, without regard to conflicts of laws thereof.
                        You hereby consent and submit to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue in the county and courts located in Birmingham, United Kingdom for any legal proceedings related
                        to the Site and App or the Terms. If any party hereto brings any suit or action against another for relief, declaratory or otherwise, arising out of these Terms,
                        the prevailing party will have and recover against the other party, in addition to all court costs and disbursements, such sum as the court may adjudge to be reasonable attorneys’ fees.
                        Except to the extent prohibited by applicable law, the parties agree that any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to use of the
                        Site and App or the Terms must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred. Sections 9, 11, 12, 13, 15 and 16 shall survive termination
                        of your account and/or the Terms.
                    </p>
                    <h4>General</h4>
                    <p>
                        You agree that no joint venture, partnership, employment or agency relationship exists between you and Go Climb as a result of the Terms or your use of the Site and App.
                        The Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and Go Climb with respect to your use of the Site and App.
                        The failure of Go Climb to exercise or enforce any right or provision of the Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.
                        If any provision of the Terms is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the court should endeavor to give effect to the parties’
                        intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other provisions of the Terms remain in full force and effect.
                        You may not assign, delegate or otherwise transfer your account or your obligations under these Terms without the prior written consent of Go Climb. Go Climb has the right,
                        in its sole discretion, to transfer or assign all or any part of its rights under these Terms and will have the right to delegate or use third party contractors to fulfill its duties
                        and obligations under these Terms and in connection with the Site and App. Go Climb’s notice to you via email, regular mail or notices or links on the Site and App shall constitute
                        acceptable notice to you under the Terms. A printed version of the Terms and of any notice given in electronic form shall be admissible in judicial or administrative proceedings based
                        upon or relating to the Terms to the same extent and subject to the same conditions as other business documents and records originally generated and maintained in printed form.
                        Section titles and headings in the Terms are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect. Any rights not expressly granted herein are reserved.
